# psychopy-eyes

## Purpose 

This repository has the current and past versions of a PsychoPy3 eye-tracking experiment, built for the Communication and Learning Lab's in-lab eye-tracker. The purpose of the experiment is to establish Potsdam Sentence Corpus-like eye-tracking corpora in Mandarin Chinese and potentially other languages using data collected from the University of Chicago community. The experiment also investigates the influence of typological, syntactic, etc. properties of a language on silent reading. 

The experiment was originally built using the PsychoPy3 Builder GUI, and afterwards the Python code of the experiment has been edited and run through the PsychoPy3 Coder interface.
